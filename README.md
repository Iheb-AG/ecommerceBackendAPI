     "passwordHash": "String",
     "isAdmin": "Boolean",
     "dateCreated": "Date"
   }
   ```

### 2. **Product**
   ```json
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId",
     "name": "String",

     "brand": "String",
     "price": "Number",
     "category": "ObjectId",
     "countInStock": "Number",
     "rating": "Number",
     "numReviews": "Number",
     "dateCreated": "Date"
   }
   ```

### 3. **Order**
   ```json
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId",
     "orderItems": [
       {
         "product": "ObjectId",
         "quantity": "Number",
         "price": "Number"
       }
     ],
     "shippingAddress": "String",
     "city": "String",
     "zip": "String",
     "country": "String",
     "phone": "String",
     "status": "String",

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for handling API routes.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing data such as users, products, and orders.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, handling database operations and schema definitions.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **bcryptjs**: For hashing and comparing passwords.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## üí° Functionalities

### 1. **User Authentication & Authorization**
   - User registration with hashed passwords.
   - Login functionality with JWT-based authentication.
   - Admin roles for managing product listings and order statuses.

### 2. **Product Management**
   - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products.
   - Filter products by category, price range, or availability.
   - Manage product stock and availability.

### 3. **Order Management**
   - Users can place orders by adding items to the cart.
   - Create, view, and update order details.
   - Track order statuses (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered).
   - Calculate total prices based on product prices and quantities.

### 4. **Category Management**
   - Create, update, and delete product categories.
   - Associate products with categories for easier filtering.
